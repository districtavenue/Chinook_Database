PROJECT NAME: CHINOOK DATABASES
SUBJECT: SQL PROJECT 

Dear, 

I copied below my coding SQL queries to demonstrate my competence and I use an open-source Database called Chinook. It's a media store where you can find Album, artist and business transactions like invoices and customers.





1. Provide a query showing Customers (just their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.


select CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS Customer_name, customer_id, country

FROM
  Customer 

WHERE NOT country ='USA';


2.Provide a query only showing the Customers from Brazil.

Select * from customer
Where Country LIKE=’Brazil’;


Invoice id, customer name and billing date and billing country

Inner joins. 


4. Provide a query showing only the Employees who are Sales Agents.
select *from employee

Where title LIKE=%Sales Support Agent%;



5. Provide a query showing a unique list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

Select billing_country
From invoice;
	







6. Provide a query showing the invoices of customers who are from Brazil.

Select
billing_country,
COUNT(customer_id) as Customer_Brazil
From
invoice

Group by 
billing_country;


7. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resultant table should include the Sales Agent's full name.


9. How many Invoices were there in 2022 and 2020? What are the respective total sales for each of those years?

Select 
	invoice_date, sum(invoice_id), sum(total) as Total_of_sales,
From 
	invoice
Where invoice_date BEWEEN 2020-01-01 and 2022-01-01
ORDER BY 
	invoice_date DESC
GROUP BY 
invoice_date;

19. Which sales agent made the most in sales in 2020?



18. Provide a query that shows total sales made by each sales agent.

select 

	e.employee_id,e.title,sum(i.total) as Sales_by_agent

from 
employee e 
LEFT JOIN	
    invoice i on   
    e.employee_id=i.invoice_id
GROUP BY 
	e.title,e.employee_id    
ORDER BY
	Sales_by_agent;

With their full name we need subqueries with joins.


19. Which sales agent made the most in sales in 2021?

select 

	e.employee_id,e.title,sum(i.total) as Sales_by_agent

from 

	employee e 
LEFT JOIN	
    invoice i on   
    e.employee_id=i.invoice_id
    

WHERE 
	invoice_date BETWEEN ‘2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z’ AND 
‘2021-12-26T00:00:00.000Z’;

GROUP BY 
	e.title,e.employee_id;



 
20.Provide a query that shows the # of customers assigned to each sales agent.
select *from employee;
select *from customer;

select e.title,CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS Customer_name


from 
	employee e 

LEFT JOIN 
	customer c on e.employee_id=c.customer_id;

















23. Provide a query that shows the total sales per country. Which country's customers spent the most?

Select billing_country, sum(total) AS Total_Sales_Per_Country

FROM
	invoice

GROUP BY
	invoice.billing_country
    
ORDER BY 
	Total_Sales_Per_Country DESC;



 
24.Provide a query that shows the most purchased track 2022.


select a.title, MAX(i.total) as Most_Purchased

from
	album a
JOIN
Invoice i on a.album_id=i.invoice_id;
WHERE 
invoice_date BETWEEN 2022-01-01 ANS 2022-12-26
GROUP BY 
	a.title;
